Description of the system:
This system is an online student assessment management information system accessible 
from any computer connected to the internet.
The assessment management module allows a teacher to manage the relevant 
assessment events for the subjects they teach. The teacher can create the courses they 
teach and set the number of assignments, their weight relative to the course, and their 
submission deadlines.
Additionally, for each course, the teacher can determine how attendance affects a 
student's grade. The teacher can also set the date of the final exam for the course and its 
weight.
The teacher can add new students to the course, update or remove them. They can record 
attendance for a class that was held and mark whether each student enrolled in the course 
was present or absent.
Moreover, the teacher can access the grade page and assign grades to the students 
enrolled in the course for each of the assignments and exams. The teacher can also 
calculate the students' final grade for the course.
Additionally, the teacher can go to the reports page and export a PDF file containing all the 
students in the course and their final grades.
At any time, the teacher can remove an existing attendance record, remove a student from 
the course list, or even delete an entire course they created.
